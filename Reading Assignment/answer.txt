- Question: What class should implement the Comparable interface?
The Media class should implement the Comparable interface since it is the base class for all media types, and we want to define a natural ordering for media items.

- Question: How should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that we want?
public int compareTo(Media other) {
        int titleComparison = this.title.compareTo(other.title);
        if (titleComparison != 0) {
            return titleComparison;
        }
        return Float.compare(this.cost, other.cost);
}

- Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
No, the Comparable interface only allows for a single natural ordering.

- Question: Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
We can create a subclass DigitalVideoDisc that overrides the compareTo() method to implement the specific ordering rule for DVDs.
